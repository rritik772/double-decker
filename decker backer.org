+ Username should not exceed 100 words.
+ Image size is limit to 10MB.
+ Post text should not exceed 10000.
+ Category should not exceed 100 word.
  - We are thinking of making it ENUM.

** Developer to user Side
+ User should now basic of markdown:
  - For adding ingredients.
  - For adding instructions.
+ No videos can be upload to website.
+ No post can exist without account.
+ Every post must have ingredients, instructions, and photos for the dish.

** Database Assumptions
+ User can/cannot have followings.
+ Initially the post like will set to zero.
+ Initially the post comments will set to None.
+ No post can exist with user.

** Other Issues
+ We can make ingredient weak entity if we can implement markdown.
+ We can make instructions weak entity if we can implement markdown.
