<li>Place 8 ounces cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, place in a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer.) Let sit out at room temperature until softened.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Meanwhile, cut 7 ounces almond paste into 1/4-inch cubes (grate on the large holes of a box grater if using an electric hand mixer). Place 2 cups shelled, salted pistachios in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and pulse until finely chopped, almost powder.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the almond paste and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar to the cream cheese. Beat on medium-high speed until evenly combined and slightly smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. (The mixture should have little chunks of almond paste throughout.) Add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and beat until just combined, about 1 minute. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li>Add the pistachios and beat on low speed until evenly distributed and the mixture turns green, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 1 cup rolled oats and beat until just combined, about 1 minute.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="5">
<li>Turn off the mixer. Stir by hand to mix in any unincorporated ingredients. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 30 minutes. (The dough will be sticky at first, but the oats will absorb excess moisture.)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="6">
<li>Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven to 350Â°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Place 1 cup powdered sugar in a small bowl.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="7">
<li>Scoop out the dough with a 1 1/2-inch wide cookie scoop or 2 rounded tablespoons portions. Roll each portion of dough in powdered sugar, coating generously and evenly. Place at least 1-inch apart on the prepared baking sheets, 12 per baking sheet.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="8">
<li>Bake for 8 minutes. Rotate baking sheets between racks. Continue to bake until the edges are dry and the powdered sugar on top starts to crack, 7 to 8 minutes more. Let cool slightly on the baking sheets for 1 to 2 minutes. (Do not let the cookies cool completely or they will not flatten.)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="8">
<li>Using the bottom of a 1-cup measuring cup, press gently and evenly down on one of the cookies to flatten to about 1/2-inch thick. Carefully remove the measuring cup and wipe the bottom of the cup with a damp paper towel. Repeat until all the cookies are smashed. Let cool for 30 minutes. The cookies will stick to the parchment paper when warm but will release when cooled using a wide, flat spatula.</li>
